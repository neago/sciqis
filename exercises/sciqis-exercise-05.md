## Day 5 (QuTiP, animations, interactive plots)

* Create an interactive visualisation using `ipywidgets` that shows the Wigner function of a vacuum state with various operations applied to it: displacement, squeezing, photon addition, etc.  Use either your own Wigner function code (should at least be possible to apply it to different number states $|0\rangle, \hat a^\dagger|0\rangle=|1\rangle, \cdots$) or QuTiP to calculate the Wigner functions.
* Create a simple animation, for example of a plot of $\cos(\omega t + \phi)$ where $\phi$ is varied. Try using both `ArtistAnimation` and `FuncAnimation` as [described in the Matplotlib docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/animations/animations.html). Check also [this tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/animation/dynamic_image.html) and [this tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/animation/simple_anim.html) (which is actually doing more or less what you're asked to do here - so try to expand on the example).
* Create an animated version of the plots in [this QuTiP tutorial](https://nbviewer.org/urls/qutip.org/qutip-tutorials/tutorials-v5/time-evolution/006_photon_birth_death.ipynb) which replicates [one of the papers on cavity QED](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05589) that contributed to the 2012 Nobel prize of Serge Haroche. You can also try to think of other ways of animating the system's behaviour.
