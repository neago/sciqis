    "It is possible (and common) to install packages into an environment — either the base or a separate one — gradually, as the need arises. However, as [remarked](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) in the conda guide, it is better to install all packages and programs from the beginning, to avoid dependency conflicts (_happens often to me!_). This is particularly true [if you need to install some packages with pip](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#pip-in-env) because they're unavailable in conda or conda-forge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For easy and consistent installation, consider using an [environment.yml file](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file), specifying all packages to be install at environment creation.\n",

    "  - jupyterlab\n",
